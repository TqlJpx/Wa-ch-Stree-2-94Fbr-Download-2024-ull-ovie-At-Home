Is ‘Stree 2’ Streaming?

No, Stree 2 is not yet available to stream. Stree 2 will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If Stree 2 arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.
